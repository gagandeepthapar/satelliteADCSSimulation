# **AERO - 421 Final Project**
**Spacecraft Attitude, Dynamics, and Control:** Simulation to determine and control a satellite's attitude in LEO.

## **Background**
AERO-421, or Spacecraft Attitude, Dynamics, and Controls, is a class taught at the California Polytechnic State University at San Luis Obispo (Cal Poly SLO) which serves as an...

> "Introduction to spacecraft attitude dynamics and control... [and] fundamentals of guidance and navigation systems... [with emphasis in] analysis and design of control systems for aerospace vehicles." - Cal Poly Aerospace Engineering Course Catalog

The final project in the course was to develop a simulation to determine a satellite's attitude in Low Earth Orbit (LEO), consider and model detumbling from a launch vehicle, consider and model disturbances due to external forces i.e., Solar Radiation Pressure (SRP), and to consider and model control via onboard reaction wheels. 

More information regarding the 6 different parts can be found below.

The initial project was developed in MATLAB, however, the project will be completely redeveloped in Python to showcase controls and software development skillsets.
